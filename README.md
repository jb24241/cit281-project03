# CIT281 Project 3

## Overview

Project goals and outcomes:

1. Create a "coinage" code module that calculates the total value of coin objects.
2. Update the "server" code file to function as a Node.js web server using the Fastify package.
3. Display an initial web page with links to test the "coinage" code.
4. Load the initial web page from a file.

## Deliverables

- `lab-03.zip`
- `lab-04.zip`
- `p3-module.js`
- `p3-server.js`
- `index.html`
- `package.json`
- `.gitignore`

These files should be placed in your `cit281/p3` folder and zipped into `p3.zip`.

## Summary

In Project 3, the focus was on creating a Node.js module to calculate the value of different coin denominations and integrating this module into a Fastify web server. The project involved creating and testing several functions in the `p3-module.js` file to handle coin calculations, as well as setting up a Fastify server in the `p3-server.js` file to serve an HTML page and handle specific routes. This project provided hands-on experience with module creation, Fastify server setup, and working with query parameters to generate dynamic responses based on user input.
